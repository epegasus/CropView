## CropView: A Custom Android View for Image Cropping in Kotlin
### Project Overview
A custom Android library that simplifies image cropping for developers using Kotlin. A tool 
to crop images with ease, allowing for adjustments such as crop area resizing, rotation, and zoom. 
CropView will aim to offer seamless integration with modern Android applications while 
being efficient and lightweight.
### Motivation
Existing Android image cropping libraries, often lack flexibility, suffer from performance issues, 
or are difficult to use. CropView will fill these gaps by offering:
• A Kotlin-friendly API to reduce boilerplate code.
• Enhanced customization options for crop areas, aspect ratios, and image transformations.
• Optimized performance for large image processing, ensuring smooth user interactions.
### Goals and Objectives
The primary goal of CropView is to deliver a customizable, lightweight, and performant cropping 
tool for Android apps. Key objectives include:
1. Customizable Crop Area: Resizable, movable crop frames with predefined aspect ratios and 
shape options (circle, square, etc.).
2. Image Manipulation: Zoom, rotate, and flip images within the crop frame.
3. Performance: Efficient handling of large images with low memory overhead.
4. Kotlin-first API: Use Kotlin language features like coroutines to streamline operations.
5. Seamless Integration: Easy integration with libraries like Glide and Picasso.
### Key Features
• Custom Crop Area: Adjustable aspect ratios, shapes (rectangular, circular), and guidelines.
• Image Manipulation: Zoom, rotate, and flip functionality with smooth transitions.
• Customizability: Fully customizable crop frame styling (color, thickness, etc.) and overlays.
• Kotlin Integration: Concise, Kotlin-first API using extension functions.
• Performance: Optimized for low memory usage and smooth performance on high-res images.
• Compatibility: AndroidX, Jetpack, and integration with image libraries like Glide.
### Target Audience
This library is intended for Android developers working on projects that require image 
cropping, such as photo-editing apps, profile photo cropping, and media-rich applications. 
It will appeal to developers seeking a customizable and efficient cropping solution with a 
modern Kotlin API
